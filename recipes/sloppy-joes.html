            <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
                <li>3/4 cup ketchup, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
                <li> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir lean ground beef in the hot skillet until some of the fat starts to render, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                Add onion and bell pepper; continue to cook until vegetables have softened and beef is cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes.</p>
            
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                    <p>Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and garlic powder; season with salt and pepper. 
                Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
            
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
                    <p>Divide meat mixture evenly among hamburger buns.</p>
            
            <h2>Tips</h2>
                    <p>If using ground beef with a higher fat content than lean, be sure to drain it before starting Step 2.</p>
