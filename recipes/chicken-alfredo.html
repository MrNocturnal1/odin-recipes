        <p>The beauty of this chicken Alfredo is that
            it's done in less than thirty minutes, ingredients are minimal,
            and there is only one pan to wash!</p>
        
        
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups of milk</li>
            <li>1 large clove garlice, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Slice each chicken breast horizontally into 3 thinner
            pieces using a sharp knife. Sprinkle each chicken piece
            with garlic salt and Italian seasoning on both sides.</p>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
            Add chicken and cook until golden and cooked through, about 2 minutes
            per side. Remove onto a plate.</p>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Add Milk and garlic to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and
                add fettuccine. Cook, stirring every 30 seconds to prevent
                sticking until pasta has softened, about 3 minutes. Reduce
                heat to medium and cook, stirring every couple of minutes, 6
                to 7 minutes more. Stir in cream and Parmesan cheese. Simmer,
                stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened and pasta is cooked,
                about 2 more minutes.</p>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Serve immediatetly and garnish with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</p>
